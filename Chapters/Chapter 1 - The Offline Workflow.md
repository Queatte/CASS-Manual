Meanwhile, the create new user screen will be displayed if there is no previous user available in the system.

## 2. School Registration
![School configuration](/assets/images/c01/c01.02-schoolConfiguration.png)

The user is expected to register at least one school to be able to use the CASS Capture application. The school registration form allows the user to select the country, enabling the software to load only the schools in the selected country. Other relevant details are supplied and saved as the default school for the application. The application allows registration of more than one school using the same computer.

## 3. Student Registration and Subjects Selection

![alt text](/assets/images/c01/c01.03-studentRegistration.png)

Users are allowed to register candidates only after a school has been registered for candidate enrolment. Candidate bio data are captured only once through the life cycle of the system to generate CASS reference ID to be used till the candidate sits for the WASSCE exam.

The subjects entered for by the candidate are captured on the same form and the subjects registered are not expected to change till the candidate sits for the WASSCE exam. However, the system makes provision for subjects to be dropped provided that the validation rules are not violated. The system also allows candidates in year 1 to modify Biodata and subject entries provided that their details have not been submitted either by exporting or directly uploading.

Transferred candidates are also captured by this form. A candidate transferring to year one is treated as a fresh candidate and a new CASS ref number shall be generated for her.
Candidates transferred to other years shall be registered with their old CASS reference number.

Candidates repeating Year One (1) shall be registered as fresh students while candidates repeating other years shall carry along their old CASS reference number.

## 4. Capturing students’ CASS

The application allows for the entering of candidates’ CASS on subject or on candidate basis. The former allows the user to enter CASS scores for all the candidates registered for a particular subject based on the CASS year while the latter allows the user to enter all the subjects CASS scores for a particular candidate for a particular year.

## 5. Manage Students Biodata and CASS details
 
The system allows users to edit students’ Biodata and subjects' selections.  Candidates in the first year can make changes to subjects’ selections until entries are generated for year 2.

Once entries are created for the second, third- and fourth-years subject could only be dropped but not replaced. This means that students cannot introduce subjects after form one. 

## 6. Exporting Students CASS
 
The application allows the user to export an encrypted file which will later be uploaded to the central CASS capture online server.

Only candidates with completed CASS in all their registered subjects are extracted. The respective country validation rules are checked during the candidates’ registration.

## 7. Upload of CASS web server
![](/assets/images/c01/c1.7.png)
The application allows the user to upload CASS directly from a system connected to the internet to the Central CASS capture online server. 
> Only candidates with completed CASS scores in all their registered subjects are uploaded.

## 8. Promoting candidates from one CASS year to another

![](/assets/images/c01/c1.8.png)

Preparing the system for capturing the CASS scores for subsequent years is done by promoting existing candidates from one CASS year to the other. The system allows the school to specify which candidates are eligible for promotion and generation of entries for subsequent CASS years by selecting the candidates. Candidates are only promoted provided that their CASS are completed for all their registered subjects for the current year.

## 9. Report generation and printing

The applications allow the following reports to be generated for the school’s documentation and record purposes:
1. Student registration validation listing – This shows the complete registered subjects and bio data for all the candidates in a specified CASS year.
2. Student CASS listing – 
![](/assets/images/c01/c1.9.2.png)
This report shows all the candidates and their respective CASS for a particular CASS year.
3. Student summary listing - 
![](/assets/images/c01/c1.9.3.png)
This report shows the summary of candidates’ records, Biodata and number of subjects registered for.
